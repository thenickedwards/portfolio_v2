# portfolio_v2
Nick Edwards - Full Stack Developer Portfolio

All portfolio code written per acceptance criteria in [W20-hw_readme.md](/W20-hw_README.md). [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) was used as a framework and [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons) were also used. All other materials (images, copy, etc.) provided by me!

Please note: due to an issue with deployment the original repo was scrapped and a new one created. To see the history of commits and progression of coe/develop ment visit: https://github.com/thenickedwards/portfolio_v2. The published repo is at https://github.com/thenickedwards/portfolio and has few commits.

## Work Done
* A single-page application portfolio for a web developer created from scratch.
* When portfolio is loaded, theh visitor is presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
* When a visitor views the header, they are presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
* When a visitor views the navigation titles, they are presented with the titles About, Work, Resume, and Contact, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
* When a visitor clicks on a navigation title, they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
* When a visitor loads the portfolio the first time, the About title and section are selected by default
* When presented with the About section, a visitors sees a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
* When presented with the Portfolio section, a visitor sees titled images of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
* When presented with the Contact section, a visitor sees a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
* When a visitor tries to submit a form with one of the form fields missing text, they receive a notification that this field is required
* When a visitor enters text into the email address field, they receive a notification if they have entered an invalid email address
* When a visitor is presented with the Resume section, they are driven to a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
